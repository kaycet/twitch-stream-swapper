# Optional: if you want to bind a custom domain/route via config, uncomment and adjust:
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "tsr-token-broker.com/*", zone_name = "tsr-token-broker.com" }
# ]

# Recommended production vars:
# - Put secrets in Cloudflare as Worker secrets:
#     TWITCH_CLIENT_ID
#     TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET
# - Put non-secrets as Worker variables:
#     ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "chrome-extension://<your-extension-id>"
# - Leave ENABLE_TOKEN_ENDPOINT unset (or not "1") so /token stays disabled in production.
